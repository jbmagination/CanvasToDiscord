# Canvas to Discord
A webhook that automatically posts Canvas announcements to Discord.

## Why?
A school club I'm in has an unofficial Discord, and they frequently have to post new Canvas announcements-- which sparked the idea. They thought it'd be helpful, so I made the first proof of concept in an hour, and polished said concept in five hours.

## Setup

## Plans
* Support Canvas API
* Support Discord bot instead of webhook
