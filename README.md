# Canvas to Discord
A webhook that automatically posts Canvas announcements to Discord.

## Why?
A school club I'm in has an unofficial Discord, and they frequently have to post new Canvas announcements-- which sparked the idea. They thought it'd be helpful, so I made the first proof of concept in an hour, and polished said concept in five hours.

My eventual goal with this project is for it to be able to support as many features as possible that Canvas announcements have, without being cluttered.

## Compatibility list
The following **WILL** display as expected:
- Regular text
- Bold text
- Italics text
- Strikethrough text
- Horizontal lines

The following **WILL NOT** display:
- Tables
- Images
- Math equations
- Most embeds

## Setup
[to write]

## Plans
* Support Canvas API
* Support Discord bot instead of webhook
